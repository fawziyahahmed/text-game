#Description
#The character will play Lost in a Jungle. The character could be any person from any age. He or 
    #She will be alone in the jungle. The jungle will be full of dangerous animals. The game will ask 
    #first the username. Then the game will call the user by their name and tell them what to do.

#Map
#you are standing in the middle of the jungle surrounded by dangerous animals. As you look for 
    #the way out, you have to move calmly and make decisions wisely. If you scream for help, the animals 
    #could hear you and then come after you. Next, you faced a bear. Your one wrong move can take you to 
    #death. So, you played dead. The bear thought you are dead so it left. Next, you saw a tiger walking by. 
    #Instead of running, you remained calm and backed away slowly and hid. It didnâ€™t see you. Now you 
    #are very hungry, but the jungle is full of poisonous fruits. You saw bananas on a banana tree which 
    #seemed edible. Instead of eating first, you gave it to a rat to try. The rat ate it and he seemed fine. 
    #So, you ate it too! Afterwards, you saw a river. If you cross it, you will be out of the jungle. But the
    #river is full of stonefish. If you swim, they will eat you. You gathered some banana trees and made a boat. Then you 
    #got on the boat and crossed the river without getting eaten by the stonefish. Finally, you are out of the jungle!
